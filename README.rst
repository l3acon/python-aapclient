Installation
============

Configure the AAP connection using either environment variables or an ``.env`` file.  Connection information may also be passed as command-line arguments.

Option 1: Environment variables (Recommended)
---------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    export AAP_HOST=https://your-aap-host.com
    # use token authentication
    export AAP_TOKEN=your-token
    # OR use user authentication
    export AAP_USERNAME=your-username
    export AAP_PASSWORD=your-password

Option 2: .env file
----------------------------------

Create a ``.env`` file in your project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Copy the example and edit with your details
    cp env.example .env

Example ``.env`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Required
    AAP_HOST=https://your-aap-host.com
    AAP_TOKEN=your-api-token

    # OR use username/password
    # AAP_USERNAME=your-username
    # AAP_PASSWORD=your-password

    # Optional
    AAP_VERIFY_SSL=false  # For self-signed certificates
    AAP_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/ca-bundle.crt
    AAP_TIMEOUT=60  # Request timeout in seconds

Usage
=====

Basic commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # List projects
    aap project list

    # Show project details
    aap project show myproject

    # Create a new project
    aap project create myproject --scm-type git --scm-url https://github.com/user/repo.git

    # Launch a job template
    aap template launch "My Job Template" --extra-vars key=value

    # List jobs
    aap job list

    # Show job output
    aap job output 123

The client organizes commands by AAP component and resource type:

Controller Commands
-------------------

* ``aap project`` - Manage projects
* ``aap inventory`` - Manage inventories
* ``aap credential`` - Manage credentials

Each resource supports standard CRUD operations where applicable:

* ``create`` - Create a new resource
* ``set`` - Update an existing resource
* ``delete`` - Delete a resource
